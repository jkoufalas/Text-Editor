# Text Editor

## Description

This is an application that allows the user input a note, add it to a list and store it on the server.

The homepage for the site is a splash page.

- The user can enter the notes area by clicking the "Get Started" button, where they will be redirected to the notes page.
- If the user manually enters a different route in the sites location other than /notes then they will be redirected back to the home page.
  <br>

The user can input a title and content in the notes area and save it to storage by pressing the save icon.

- The stored note is added to the list on the left.
- The user can reload a note to the main note area by clicking the note.
- The user can delete the note by clicking the delete icon on that note.
  <br>

To clear the note area so a new note can be entered the user can click the plus (+) icon at the top.

- The user can only add the note when there is content within the title and text area.
